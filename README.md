# Grab-Scraping
Scraps longitudes and latitudes of restaurants from Grab's Website 

This project uses puppeteer for scraping. 

# Approach
For fetching the latitude and longitude of the restaurants, I'm tracking the response for a background request which is made by the site as the user scrolls
through the restaurants list. <br>
Using that response I storing the latitude and longitude of the restaurants in a JSON file.
